**Laptop users: Fix for invisible models/mobs**

If you're on a gaming laptop and your character is invisible in third person, or mobs aren't rendering - your laptop might be using the wrong GPU.

I made a tool that fixes this: https://github.com/DailyNum/HytaleGPUFix/releases/latest

**What it does:** Forces Hytale to use your gaming GPU (NVIDIA/AMD) instead of integrated graphics.

**Only works if:** You have 2 GPUs (most gaming laptops do). Check Task Manager → Performance to see if you have two.

Won't help with actual game bugs - just GPU selection issues.
